# Web Theme Creator

This is a tool for designers and web developers to aid in choosing color
themes for their web apps.  It lets you specify a background color and a
number of theme colors, then provides a side-by-side comparison of each
color combination, as well as giving information about contrast ratios
and providing samples of what the color comparisons might look like for
individuals with various forms of color blindness.  Once you have you've
got the colors you want, it lets you generate a CSS or SASS stub that
you can include in your project to define CSS custom properties or SASS
variables for each color you've selected.
